# To-Do-App

This is a simple, yet cool To-Do-App written in pure JS. It is tested and works fine with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Opera. It makes use of the local storage technology, which means it stores data locally, within the user's browser. Once you open the app in a certain browser, you'll have to keep using the same browser in order to be able to see and access the stored data.
